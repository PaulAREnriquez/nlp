    "So far, the embeddings that we have learned are described as `static`. This means that the vector representation for a given token **regardless** of the `context` in which the token occurs.\n",

    "Static word embeddings cannot capture this distinction because words will always have the same vector representation. The values of the `n-dimensional` vector remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to encode the context by which a word occurs to draw out these differences in meaning, using an architecture called **`Transformers`**.\n",

    "A **`Transformer`** is a neural network architecture that is capable of encoding information about the context which a token occurs. It improved performance for traditional natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing, but it is `computationally heavy`."
