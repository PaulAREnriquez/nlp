#### **Natural Language Processing**

This is all about the basics of natural language processing, techniques used to vectorize text, and its application to sentiment analysis using neural network.

First, run the command to install repository requirements:
`pip install - r requirements.txt`

Read (or run) the notebooks according to this order:

1. nlp
2. tfidf
3. word_embeddings
4. document_embeddings
5. contextual_embeddings
6. evaluation-of-techniques
7. tweets-ann-torch_2
8. tweets-ann-autoencoder
9. tweets-ann-balanced

Tokenized tweets and the target variable array are stored in `notebooks/csvs`.

Feature vectors will be saved in `notebooks/vectors`, although only the output vector from `TfidfVectorizer` is stored, and all others are ignored because of their size. Nonetheless, all these vectors will be stored in that said folder.

Much of the explanations are in `markdown` cells of each notebook, to provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the topics. Pictures attached are from the word document `Feature Extraction Techniques.docx` which is also available with this repository.

This repository serves as a partial requirement to a project administered by Mr. Raphael Alampay, but also as a valuable resource for the author.

Thank you, and may we all have the intuition we wanted to have in the realm of *Natural Language Processing!*
